## Real-Time-Stock-Price
This project allows users to retrieve and visualize real-time stock prices for any company using the Yahoo Finance API. The user-friendly interface is powered by Streamlit, providing an intuitive way to interact with the data. The script enables users to input the ticker symbol of the company they wish to analyze. It then fetches and displays the stock prices for the specified company within the last year, along with additional information such as the start and end dates of the data.
## Features

# Interactive Visualization: 
The script generates an interactive line plot, showcasing the closing prices of the selected stock over time.
# Error Handling: 
In case of invalid input or API errors, the script gracefully handles exceptions and notifies the user.
